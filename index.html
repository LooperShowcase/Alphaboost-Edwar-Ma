      Founder Ettore Bugatti was born in Milan, Italy, and the automobile
      company that bears his name was founded in 1909 in Molsheim located in the
      Alsace region which was part of the German Empire from 1871 to 1919. The
      company was known both for the level of detail of its engineering in its
      automobiles, and for the artistic manner in which the designs were
      executed, given the artistic nature of Ettore's family (his father, Carlo
      Bugatti (1856â€“1940), was an important Art Nouveau furniture and jewelry
      designer).
